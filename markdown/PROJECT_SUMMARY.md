- ✅ **4-Category Error Classification**: Simple one-click categorization of mistakes.
- ✅ **Advanced Data Management**:
  - **Export**: Standard CSV and Excel-optimized (UTF-8-BOM) options.
  - **Import**: Multi-file upload and merge capabilities with automatic deduplication based on timestamp.
- ✅ **Delete Mode**: Intuitive interface for bulk deletion of logged mistakes.
- ✅ **Real-time Mistake History**: Instantly view the last 10 entries, sorted with the newest first.
- ✅ **Notes & Context**: Add detailed notes for each mistake.

## 🧠 **Core Logic & Functions (For Developers)**
This section details the primary logic to help new developers understand the application's inner workings.

#### 1. The Parsing Engine: `parse_text()` & `PARSING_RULES`
The heart of the application is its ability to extract structured data from unstructured text.
-   **`PARSING_RULES` Dictionary**: This global constant defines an ordered list of regular expressions for each data field (e.g., `Category`, `Time Spent`).
-   **Fallback Logic**: For each field, the rules are ordered from most specific to most general. The `parse_text()` function iterates through these rules and stops at the *first successful match*. This provides robustness against variations in the input format.
-   **`parse_text(raw_text)` function**: Takes raw pasted text, applies the `PARSING_RULES` using the fallback logic, and returns a dictionary of parsed data.

#### 2. Data Integrity & Storage: `save_to_csv()` & `read_csv_safe()`
These functions ensure the CSV log remains clean and uncorrupted.
-   **`read_csv_safe(filepath)`**:
    -   **Encoding Fallbacks**: Attempts to read the CSV with `utf-8-sig`, then `utf-8`, then `latin-1`.
    -   **Column Standardization**: Guarantees the loaded DataFrame contains all `REQUIRED_COLUMNS`, adding any that are missing.
    -   **Data Cleaning**: Fills all `NaN` values with empty strings and converts all columns to `str` to prevent downstream errors.
-   **`save_to_csv(data)`**:
    -   **Atomic Writes**: Uses a `threading.Lock` to ensure only one write operation can occur at a time, preventing race conditions.
    -   **Safe CSV Formatting**: Writes data with `quoting=1` (`QUOTE_ALL`) to ensure fields containing commas or special characters are correctly escaped.

#### 3. Application State Management: `st.session_state`
The interactive workflow is managed using Streamlit's session state.
-   `st.session_state.parsed_data`: Stores the dictionary returned by `parse_text()`. The UI dynamically shows/hides elements based on whether this state is populated and valid.
-   `st.session_state.text_input_key`: An incrementing key used to force Streamlit to re-render the text input widget, effectively clearing it after a save.
-   `auto_save_and_clear()`: Orchestrates state changes. After saving, it nullifies `parsed_data` and increments widget keys to reset the UI for the next entry.

#### 4. Data Management Logic: `load_old_log()` & `delete_selected_mistakes()`
-   **`load_old_log(uploaded_file)`**: Merges an uploaded CSV with the current log. It uses `drop_duplicates(subset=['Timestamp'], keep='last')` to handle conflicts, prioritizing records from the newly uploaded file.
-   **`delete_selected_mistakes(selected_indices)`**: Reads the CSV, uses `df.drop()` to remove rows by their original index, and overwrites the file with the modified DataFrame.

## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture**
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (Python web framework)
- **Data Storage**: CSV files with pandas processing
- **Text Processing**: Regex-based parsing with configurable rules
- **Data Integrity**:
  - Multi-encoding read fallbacks.
  - Thread-safe atomic file writes.
  - Column and data type standardization.

## 🚀 **Deployment Ready**
- **Streamlit Cloud**: Ready for one-click deployment
- **GitHub Integration**: Full CI/CD setup
- **Configuration**: Optimized for cloud hosting
- **Dependencies**: Minimal, lightweight requirements

## 📊 **Data Structure**
```

```

## 🛠️ **Recent Improvements**
1. **Fixed CSV corruption issues** - Proper quoting and encoding
2. **Resolved NaN display problems** - Data type standardization  
3. **Enhanced File Upload** - Added multi-file support with deduplication.
4. **Added Delete Mode** - Implemented bulk deletion functionality.
5. **Improved Parser Logic** - Refined regex rules for better accuracy.
6. **Session State Optimization** - Ensured clean state resets after each entry.

## 🎯 **Target Users**
- CFA exam candidates
- Study groups and tutors
- Anyone tracking learning progress with structured data

##  **Data Workflow**
1.  **Input**: User pastes text into `st.text_area`.
2.  **Parse**: `parse_text()` is called, populating `st.session_state.parsed_data`.
3.  **Validate**: `is_valid_data()` checks the parsed data; UI updates to show save options.
4.  **Enrich & Save**: User selects an error type, triggering `auto_save_and_clear()`. This function adds the error type and notes, calls `save_to_csv()`, and resets the session state.
5.  **Display**: The "Logged Mistake History" section re-reads the CSV via `read_csv_safe()` on every script run to show the latest data.

## 🔧 **Maintenance**
- **Code Quality**: Clean, documented, maintainable
- **Error Prevention**: Comprehensive input validation
- **Performance**: Optimized for single-user sessions
- **Scalability**: Ready for multi-user enhancement
